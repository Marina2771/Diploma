Within two hours of ordering it got delivered to the house and its like she knew it was at the door. She absolutely hates taking her medicine but she truly loves her Mixlab box because it’s so informative, quick, easy to order but especially because includes a new toy each time! Thank you Mixlab for always taking care of her! She can’t wait to place her next order now!”', 'assets/images/insta_sign.png', 'Tootsie, CA')

Needless to say, getting that much medication in her has been very difficult. BUT thanks to Mixlab an incredible compounding pharmacy for pets, Mizu has been taking her meds like a champ! And look at the incredible packaging MixlabRx sends our medications in! It came with hand sanitizer, rattie toys and even a cute little note just for Mizu!!! Customer service was wonderful AND delivery is same day and free!!! I cannot recommend this place enough for your furry babies! This is not a sponsored ad. I am just so in love with this company and the people who work there. Special thank you to Bahar who was Mizu’s pharmacist! Mizu is taking her meds now and that is a miracle!!! ✨💕✨ Go Mizu Go!!! 💪🏼🐭🌟"', 'assets/images/insta_sign.png', 'Mizu, CA')
            +slider__block('assets/images/slider_img2.png', '"I wish I could give Mixlab ten stars! Their customer service is beyond outstanding. They send a text update to let me know when they have received a prescription from the vet and then another to ask when I would like it delivered - usually the same day! The meds themselves are cleverly packaged in a box with a personal note to my dog, Olive, and a toy for her inside. I wish my prescriptions came this way! (Well, maybe minus the toy.) To top it off, Mixlab texts a few days later to see how Olive is doing. If you are not using this pharmacy for your pet has medications, you are seriously missing out."', 'assets/images/insta_sign.png', 'Olive, NYC')
